This is just a test. I'm testing this basic extension by loading the unpacked source code into Chrome.
"host_permissions" and "cherryURL" have to be set, and the user has to be logged in first.
This will be improved by using the Personal Access Token provided in Cherry.

- Login to your cherry instance
- Type "cy" + tab in the search bar to search.
