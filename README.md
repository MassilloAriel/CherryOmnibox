This is just a test. Worked on it for maybe 2 hours.

I'm testing this basic extension by loading the unpacked source code into Chrome.

"host_permissions" and "cherryURL" have to be set to the URL where Cherry is self-hosted, and the user has to be logged in first.

This will be improved by using the Personal Access Token provided in Cherry (once I figure out how it works).

- Login to your Cherry instance
- Type "cy" + tab in the search bar to search.
